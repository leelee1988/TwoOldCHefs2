  I started the structure for my app mainly focusing on buttons and the home screen. I spent alot of time on personalizing the buttons and learning alot about constraint, as well as how the activity xml files actually work.
  This was my favorite resource out of the many i read through. Gave me a better idea of how my code should work and function,

  This was the most productive but hardest day because i got alot done but learned alot about intent and how it works. intent is used very heavily in this project.
  Intent can be used for alot of different things and can make your code look neater and a little bit easier to understand.
  This the resource i used  for intent https://javatutorial.net/android-intent-example
