 Watching Tutorials from john from  cave of programming.(
Learned:
   I learned what IDE's, plugins, and SDK's that needed to be downloaded if i chose to use eclipse here's what i would need, and just good knowledge. the ADT plugin and android SDK can be found on the android developer website. John also showed step by step to which i took notes on onenote on how to apply the ADT plugin and SDK on eclipse. I also learned what an emulator is and how to create on eclipse. John then showed how to run a hello word program through the emulator to which i have step by step notes on my OneNote. I learned how to make an edit text editor, buttons , and linear layout on the emulator. i also learned about android xml layout files which consist of view groups and views. These view groups have layout syntax that layout various widgets and the views are the real widgets. This concludes what i learned.
   Side note: android studio is the prefered IDE now which i will be using.

  I started the structure for my app mainly focusing on buttons and the home screen. I spent a lot of time on personalizing the buttons and learning a lot about constraint, as well as how the activity xml files actually work.
  This was my favorite resource out of the many i read through. Gave me a better idea of how my code should work and function,

  This was the most productive but hardest day because i got a lot done but learned a lot about intent and how it works. intent is used very heavily in this project.
  Intent can be used for a lot of different things and can make your code look neater and a little bit easier to understand.
  This the resource i used  for intent https://javatutorial.net/android-intent-example

       end time: 11:00 pm
I learned how to reference pdf files using intent and integrating it into the app.  https://javatutorial.net/android-intent-example again this resource was my favorite.
and was a big help with that.
